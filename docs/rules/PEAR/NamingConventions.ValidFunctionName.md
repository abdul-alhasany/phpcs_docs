# ValidFunctionName

Ensures method and function names are correct.

### Scope

`PEAR.NamingConventions.ValidFunctionName`

## Description

Functions and methods should be named using the "studly caps" style (also referred to as "bumpy case" or "camel caps"). Functions should in addition have the package name as a prefix, to avoid name collisions between packages. The initial letter of the name (after the prefix) is lowercase, and each letter that starts a new "word" is capitalized.

## Usage

```xml
<rule ref="PEAR.NamingConventions.ValidFunctionName"></rule>
```
